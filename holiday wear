    <div class="desc">MOUNTAIN WEAR -<br>Soft-shell climbing pants are more durable than hiking pants and they do a better job of blocking wind and rain. Their stretchy fabric gives you the range of motion you need for climbing mountains. </div>

    <div class="desc">STAYCATION WEAR--<br>Resort wear refers to vacation wear that's worn at resorts or on cruises. More specifically, the term "elegant resort wear" may be used to discourage choices that are so casual as to be inappropriate. As a general rule, resort style is geared toward warmer weather and walks the line between comfort and elegance.</div>

    <div class="desc">HISTORICAL PLACE WEAR--<br>In general, you should wear something casual and comfortable to a museum, as you will most likely be doing lots of walking. You don't want to wear very tight clothing, clothing that is hard to move around in, or uncomfortable shoes.</div>

    <div class="desc">BEACH WEAR--<br>Opt for a lightweight, flowy maxi dress in breathable fabric like regenerative cotton or linen," says Dawn, adding that a woven bag or clutch is the perfect beachy touch. "Not only does it complement the beach aesthetic, but it also adds texture and interest to your outfit."</div>
